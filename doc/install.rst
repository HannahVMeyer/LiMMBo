LiMMBo is currently available via `pip`_ and will in the future be available 
through `conda-forge`_ . The latter platform provides the
recommended installation of `LIMIX`_, which
LiMMBo heavily relies on.

The recommended way of installing both packages is the following:
Install LIMIX via `conda`_::

   conda install -c conda-forge limix


After successful installation of LIMIX, simply install LiMMBo via `pip`_::

   pip install limmbo
